## Image Gallery

This project is a simple image gallery built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view images in a lightbox and provides a hover effect for each image.

### Features:

- **Dynamic Image Loading:** Images are dynamically added to the gallery using JavaScript, making it easy to add or update images.
- **Lightbox View:**  A lightbox effect allows users to view a single image in a larger size within the same window.
- **Image Hover Effect:** Images slightly zoom in when the mouse hovers over them, providing visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design:** The gallery and lightbox should adapt to different screen sizes.

### How to Use:

1. **Download the Code:** Download the project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`).
2. **Create an `images` Folder:** Create a folder named "images" in the same directory as your HTML file.
3. **Add Images:**  Place your image files (e.g., `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`) inside the "images" folder.
4. **Update Image Paths:** In the `images` array in `script.js`, replace the placeholder image URLs with the actual paths to your images (e.g., `src: 'images/image1.jpg'`).
5. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser:** The image gallery will load and display your images. 

### Technologies:

- **HTML:** Structure of the gallery
- **CSS:** Styling for the gallery, lightbox, and image effects
- **JavaScript:**  Dynamic image loading and lightbox functionality
